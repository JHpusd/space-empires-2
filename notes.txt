scout atk vs scout def
3/10 chance of hitting

scout atk vs bc def
2/10 chance of hitting

bc atk vs scout def
5/10 chance of hitting

bc atk vs bc def
4/10 chance of hitting

STRAT 1 (basic ideas): -> ended up just being "shoot bcs first"

add threat level
(hp * atk) + def
default scout: 3
default bc: 11
hurt bc: 6

add vulnerability level
10/hp - 2*def
default scout: 10
default bc: 3
hurt bc: 8

add target weight
threat * vulnerability * chance of hit
scout vs default scout: 9
scout vs default bc: 6
scout vs hurt bc: 8
bc vs default scout: 15
bc vs default bc: 13.2
bc vs hurt bc: 19.2

EDIT TO ABOVE: if target weight is within 10% of another choice, use random

STRAT 2 (add prioritizations towards threat or vulnerability based on ship's stats):
ex. scout would prioritize vulnerability because low atk

scout priority: scout, hurt bc, bc (vulnerability * chance of hit)
bc priority: hurt bc, bc, scout (vulnerability * threat)
